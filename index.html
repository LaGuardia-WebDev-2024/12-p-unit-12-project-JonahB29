        <p class="memory-text">I had so much fun dancing in Seattle at the Pacific Northwest Ballet's summer program. I improved my ballet technique on flat and en pointe, learned how to partner dancers, and learned some of the Balanchine repetoire! My dance technique and artisty definitely improved while I was there, and I had so much fun with my friends! </p>

        <p class="memory-text">I got to perform a soloist role in my studio's production of the Nutcracker. The production was a New York themed Nutcracker called The KnickerBocker Suite! I danced the roles of a Harlequin in a paintying at a Museum, the soloist role of a baseball player or a football player at a stadium, and a Parks Department officer dnacing in Central Park, which wa sthe secodn Principal role! I loved perofrming for an audience. I loved moving with the music, and although it wa scary, I was thrilled to be in the spotlight!</p>

        <p class="memory-text"> I COMMITED TO INDIANA UNIVERSITY FOR COLLEGE!!!! I will be majoring in ballet at the Jacob's School of Music! I will also be studying an outside field which I have yet to decide. I will likely study business, with an emphasis on music business, or kinesiology/ exercise science! I am so excited to continue my dance journey for the next 4 years! I will have the chnace to learn from amazing faculty. There are amazing performance opportunities. I will get to perform Blanchine repertory at some point, which has been a dream of mine. I also get to perofrm a solo on the second biggest stage in the country within my first few months there. I am hyped for the D1 college experience at IU, I think I will have an amazing time there!!</p>
